== Introduction

VetterAppointments is a Java based application that helps manage the appointments of a veterinarian.
This guide will aid an incoming developer to understand the architecture and underlying interface of the application.
This guide will walk through the process of setting up the program and building upon it.

== Setting Up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the Project in Your Computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the Setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to Do Before Writing Code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600", caption="Figure 3-1. "]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Logic Component Class Diagram
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-2. "]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-3. "]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component Interactions for `delete 1` Command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-4. "]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-5. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-6. "]

Figure 3-7 shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 3-6.

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component.
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-7. "]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Figure 3-8 shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-8. "]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-9. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3-10. "]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. Figure 4-1 shows the inheritance diagram for commands.

.Logic Command Class Diagram
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-1. "]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

.Undo/Redo Initial Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-2. "]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-3. "]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

The program will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. Next the program will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command was executed.

.Undo/Redo Executed Undo Command Stack Diagram
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-4. "]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

Figure 4-5 shows a sequence diagram of how the undo operation works:

.Undo/Redo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-5. "]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (Clear)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-6. "]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.Undo/Redo New Command Stack Diagram (List)
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-7. "]

Figure 4-8 shows the activity diagram that summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Undo/Redo Activity Digram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650", caption="Figure 4-8. "]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Pet Component Feature

==== Reasons for implementation

VetterAppointments is designed for vets who manages his team of vet technician, clients and most importantly, the pets.
The Pet component feature stores the necessary Pet details like name, gender, age, tags as well as appointment.
Such details are essential to facilitate other functions such as viewing the client's appointments and the pet's appointments at a glance displayed on the GUI.

==== Current implementation

*Model component* +
Currently the `Pet` object is initialized by calling it's constructor. The constructor
initializes the four fields of `Pet` to respective arguments supplied by the user. +

*Constructing a `Pet` object*
[source,java]
----
public Pet(PetName petName, PetAge petAge, PetGender petGender, Set<Tag> tags) {
    requireAllNonNull(petName, petAge, petGender, tags);
    this.petName = petName;
    this.petAge = petAge;
    this.petGender = petGender;
    this.tags = tags;
}
----
Explanation for arguments: +

`PetName`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pn/`. It stores the details of the pet name
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetName` validates the name of the pet supplied. Only alphanumeric characters are allowed. +

The constraints for a valid pet name is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String PETNAME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[\\p{Alnum}][\\p{Alnum} ]*";
----

`PetAge`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pa/`. It then stores the details of the pet age
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetAge` validates the age supplied by the user. Only 1-2 digit numbers are allowed. +

The constraints for a valid pet age is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String PET_VALIDATIONS_REGEX = "\\d{1,2}";
----

`Petgender`: A class that takes in a String supplied by the user with the prefix `pg\`. It stores the pet gender details
and creates an object for the `Pet` constructor to consume.
[NOTE]
The `PetGender` validates for supplied gender. Only M or F is allowed, representing Male or Female.
It is case insensitive. +

The constraints for a valid pet gender is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public static final String GENDER_VALIDATION_REGEX = "[m,f,M,F]";
----

`Set<Tag>`: In addition to the PetName, PetAge and PetGender, a `Set<Tag>` is also needed for the construction of a `Pet` object. +
[NOTE]
The tags for a pet is used to represent the species and breed for that particular pet. +

All the `Pet` objects that were created in the program will be stored in a class called `UniquePetList`.
The `UniquePetList` class ensures that no duplicates of the same pet are stored inside the program.

The figure below shows a simple overview of the `Pet` class. +

.Pet class diagram snippet
image::pet_diagram_snippet.png[width="790", caption="Figure 4-9. "]

==== Logic component
The `Pet` object interacts with several commands in the program. +
1. `addp` +
2. `deletep` +
3. `list pet` +
4. `sortp` `*NOT IMPLEMENTED YET*` +
5. `addapptto` `*NOT IMPLEMENTED YET*` +
6. `findp` `*NOT IMPLEMENTED YET*` +

==== Storage component
All pet details will be stored in a seperate XML file.

==== UI component
All pet information will be displayed in the UI in a `Pet` list. All changes made to the pet will be reflected immediately after interacting with the commands.

// tag::addpettoclient[]
=== Add Pet to Client Feature
==== Current Implementation
The `AddPetToClientCommand` allows the user to add an existing pet to and existing client. A user can execute the command by providing the index of the pet and the index of the client in the following format `addpettoclient p/PET_INDEX c/CLIENT_INDEX`.

.Structure of the Logic Component
image::addpettoclient_logic_command_class_diagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-10. "]
As seen from Figure 4-10, the `AddPetToClientCommand` is implemented to extend an `UndoableCommand` which enables the user to undo and redo the `AddPetToClientCommand` that is executed.
The `AddPetToClientCommand` interacts with the `Model` component to add pet to a client.

Figure 4-11 show the sequence diagram of how the add pet to client command works.

.Interaction of the Logic Component for `addpetto p/1 c/1` Command
image::addpettoclientSequence.png[width="800" caption="Figure 4-11. "]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of `AddPetToClientCommand`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new command that extends `UndoableCommand`
** Pros: We will be able to utilize undone/redone functionality.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand undo/redo implementation.
* **Alternative 2:** Just add a new command that extends `Command`
** Pros: Does not involve `UndoableCommand`, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the add pet to client command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an association class `ClientOwnPet` to link `Pet` and `Client`
** Pros: Low coupling between `Pet` and `Client`.
** Cons: More steps required for other implementations to obtain pet and client relationship.
* **Alternative 2:** Bi-directional association between `Pet` with `Client`
** Pros: Need not need to maintain a separate association class.
** Cons: High coupling.
// end::addpettoclient[]

=== List and display clients, pets and vet technicians

==== Current Implementation

The side bar of the user interface implements a `TabPane` with three tabs,
'Client', 'Pet' and 'Vet Tech' where clicking on each tab will show the
corresponding list. We will use the pet list to demonstrate the implementation.

The 'Pet' `Tab` consists of a `StackPane` called `petListPanelPlaceholder` in the `MainWindow.fxml` file.

In the `MainWindow.java` file, the `petListPanel`
retrieves the updated list of pets from `logic`, and the `petListPanel` is added to `petListPanelPlaceholder` to be displayed like so:

[source, java]
----
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Stage> {
    void fillInnerParts() {
        petListPanel = new PetListPanel(logic.getFilteredPetList());
        petListPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(petListPanel.getRoot());
        // ...other placeholders...
    }
}
----

The `PetListPanel` is a `ListView` which contains a list of `PetCard` which is implemented like so:

[source, java]
----
public class PetListPanel extends UiPart<Region> {

    @FXML
    private ListView<PetCard> petListView;

    private void setConnections(ObservableList<Pet> petList) {
        ObservableList<PetCard> mappedList = EasyBind.map(
                petList, (pet) -> new PetCard(pet, petList.indexOf(pet) + 1));
        petListView.setItems(mappedList);
        petListView.setCellFactory(listView -> new PetListViewCell());
    }
}
----

The `PetCard` contains a single pet and sets the pet's details and the layout of the display of details.

Figure 4-12 below is a screenshot of the final displayed pet list, where each pet, for example 'Garfield',
is contained in a `PetCard`, and the cards of all pets are presented in a list form by using `PetListPanel`.

.Screenshot of a List of Pets
image::list_pet.png[width="350" caption="Figure 4-12. "]

Aside from toggling the lists by clicking on the tabs, the `list` command is implemented to take in a parameter
of either 'client', 'pet' or 'vettech' so that the list view updates appropriately when the `list` command is used.

To implement this, depending on the parameter, the `ListCommand` creates and adds `ChangeListTabEvent`
to `EventCenter` like so:
[source, java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
        public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {

            switch (targetType) {
            case "pet":
                model.updateFilteredPetList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PET);
                EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ChangeListTabEvent(1));
                break;
                // ...other cases...
            }
            // ...return...
        }
}
----

The `MainWindow` then handles the `ChangeListTabEvent` by changing to the corresponding list on the UI display,
and updates `logic` with the index of the current list so that other commands like `edit` and `delete`
can perform the command on the correct list, like so:

[source, java]
----
public class MainWindow extends UiPart<Stage> {
    @Subscribe
    private void handleChangeListTabEvent(ChangeListTabEvent event) {
        changeTo(event.targetList);
        logic.setCurrentList(event.targetList);
    }
    private void changeTo(int list) {
        Platform.runLater(() -> {
            listPanel.getSelectionModel().select(list);
        });
    }
}
----

With this implementation, whether changing list by mouse-click or by command,
the application always contains the index of the current list being viewed,
so that the correct list will be displayed, and so that all other commands will
be executed on the correct list.

// tag::scheduleappt[]
=== Schedule feature
This feature supports one of the main functionality of *Vetter Appointments* which is to facilitate the process of scheduling appointments with clients.

==== Current Implementation
*Model component* +

* *Overview*:
In order to schedule an appointment, the Vet must create an appointment by specifying the date, time and duration.

The diagram(Figure 4-13)  below illustrates the overview of the appointment class. +

.overview the appointment class in addressbook
image::ModelAppointmentClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-13. "]

As you can see from the class diagram Figure 4-13, there are three attributes of an appointment and each of them is implemented by an individual class.

* *Components*: +
Date & time +
We are not using the java date and time class but implementing our self-defined classes. The reason is to check the invalidity more efficiently.

The diagrams(Figure 4-14) below shows the class diagram for date and time. +

.Date and time class diagram snippets
image::AppointmentClassDemo.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-14. "]

The method to check for for a valid date is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
 public static final String DATE_VALIDATION_REGEX =
            "([2-9][0-9][1-9][89])-(0?[1-9]|1[012])-(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])";
----
By checking the date regex, only date entered in the format of YYYY-MM-DD will be accepted.

[NOTE]
The year should be later than 2018

The method to check for a valid time is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
 public static final String TIME_VALIDATION_REGEX = "([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):([0-5][0-9])";
----
By checking the time regex, only time entered in the format of HH:MM will be accepted.

[NOTE]
Time is expressed in 24 hour format hence hour ranges from 00 to 23 and minute from 01 to 60. +

Duration +

The diagram(Figure 4-15) below shows the class diagram of duration. +

.Duration class diagram snippet
image::AppointmentClassDemo2.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-15. "]

The method to check for a valid duration is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
 public static final String DURATION_VALIDATION_REGEX = "(1[5-9]|[2-9][0-9]|1[01][0-9]|120)";
----

[NOTE]
Duration can be either two or three digit number and the value is in minute.

Appointment +

The diagram(Figure 4-16) below shows the class diagram of appointment. +

.Appoint class diagram snippet
image::AppointmentClassDemo3.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-16. "]

To differentiate appointments, the equals method is implemented this way:

[source,java]
----
public boolean equals(Object other) {
    ......
    ......
    Appointment otherAppointment = (Appointment) other;
    return otherAppointment.getDate().equals(this.getDate())
           && otherAppointment.getTime().equals(this.getTime());
}
----

[NOTE]
Only date and time are responsible for duplicate appointments.

==== Logic component
The following diagram(Figure 4-17) shows how the schedule command works. +

.Interactions inside the Logic Component for `schedule date time duration` Command
image::ScheduleLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-17. "]

As you can see from the above diagram, the schedule command first goes to the `logicManager` and then get parsed by the `ScheduleCommand Parser`.
After getting the appointment object from `Model`, the command result returns to `LogicManager`.

==== Storage component
The following diagram(Figure 4-18) shows how the appointment be stored in the addressBook. +

.Stores the appointment
image::AppointmentStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4-18. "]

As shown in the above diagram Figure 4-18, appointments are saved and read back in xml format.
// end::scheduleappt[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF Format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of Tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* Occupation as a vet
* Has a need to manage a significant number of clients, pets and appointments
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*:

Allow vets to easily manage their clients and schedule appointments

*Feature Contributions*:

*Jonathan Weng*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support auto-complete for all commands
+
[none]
** When the vet presses the 'Tab' button on the keyboard once while in the command box, the application
will auto-complete the text. Auto-complete support not only works on command words, but also when
searching for the names of existing clients, pets and vet technicians in the application. This will allow the vet
to partially type a command and quickly complete it to improve typing efficiency.
** When the vet presses the 'Tab' button on the keyboard twice in quick succession while in the command box,
the application will list down all possible text to be auto-completed to.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Support for adding clients and vet technicians to the application
+
[none]
** The `add` command now takes in a ROLE parameter (either 'Client' or 'VetTechnician')
so that the vet can add the new person to the correct list.
** The `delete` and `edit` command will also allow the vet to remove and edit clients and vet technicians.

*Md Azhar*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support all pet related commands
+
[none]
** The `addp`, `deletep` and `editp` commands will support the updating of the
pet list whenever the vet requires to add a pet to the list, delete a pet from the list
or edit a pet that currently exists in the list.
** The `findp` command will allow the vet to efficiently search for a pet of a specific name
in the list.
** The `addapptto` command will add an appointment to an existing pet in the application.
This will allow the vet to easily schedule an appointment for the relevant pet.
The vet will also state the date, time, vet technician assigned to the appointment as well
as any comments he/she wishes to add. `rmapptfrom` will remove the appointment from a pet.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Implement aliases for command words +

[none]
** The aliases of command words will allow the vet to reduce the amount of typing
required for command words, to increase efficiency in using the application.

*Choo Wen Xin*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support all new list commands and display on UI
+
[none]
** The `list` command now takes in a parameter (either 'client', 'pet' or 'vettech')
which will toggle the tabs in the sidebar of the application and display the appropriate list
for easy viewing and keeping track.
** The `list appt` command will display all appointments in the main section of the application
listed in date order, and in time order within each (date) section. This is for the vet to
easily keep track of his/her appointments in chronological order.
** The `listall` command will take in a client index parameter and display all the
pets and appointments the particular client has in the main section of the application. This is to easily see the relevant
details when dealing with a client.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Reorganization of UI display
+
[none]
** The display will now have a header bar, displaying the application logo and name,
and the command and result bar will be moved into the top of the right splitpane instead.

*Zhong Zheng Xin*

[none]
* *Major Enhancement*: Support for all appointment related commands
+
[none]
** The `schedule` command allows the vet to schedule an appointment of a certain date and time.
** The `editappt` command allows the vet to update the details of an appointment,
such as the assigned vet technician and the data and time. Client and Pet can be
changed as well if necessary. The affected clients, pets and vet technicians should
be updated accordingly as well.
** The `deleteappt` command allows the vet to delete an appointment he/she no longer wants.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Add constraints to Appointment parameters
+
[none]
** The application will prompt the vet if he/she has scheduled an appointment that
clashes with or is too close to another appointment. Only appointments with reasonable
date and time can be scheduled to help the vet maintain appropriate appointment schedules.
