== Introduction

VetterAppointments is a program for vets who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their Clients, Pets and Appointments. +

The app is optimized for Vets who prefer to work with the *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that clearly lists out what is important to him or her. +

VetterAppointments allows a vet to manage and complete his tasks faster than the traditional GUI app provided he or she is a fast typer. To get started with the app, head down to <<Quick Start>> to get started!
