== Introduction

If you're a vet and have trouble managing your clients' appointments, then *VetterAppointments* is the right program for you. +

*VetterAppointments* allows you to have better control of your scheduling process
and manages them better by organizing all of your appointments and
displays only important information to you. The program strips away any unnecessary clutter
and allows you to focus on what matters to you the most; your clients, the animals under your
care and their appointments, and your staff. This allows the program to help you out on managing your clients. +

*VetterAppointments* works on a Command Line Interface (CLI) feature supported by a well thought-out Graphical User Interface (GUI).
This allows you to quickly type in the commands in the command box instead of messing around with the interface. Do bear in mind that
anything that could be done with the mouse can also be done by commands in the program. +

Don't worry, this user guide will help you along and guide you on how to get *VetterAppointments* up and running
as well as reveal all the features and commands available to you.



== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `VetterAppointments.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]. You'll be
see the version releases of the program there similar to the image below.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your VetterAppointments.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The program should start up and looks like the image below.

*Understanding the Command Format*

We'll need to understand how a command format is laid out before diving into the program.

Here's an example of a command format: +
`add r/ROLE n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

* The first word of the command format `add` states the *type* of the command. There are many *types* of commands like
`addp` `addappttopet` `deletep` and etc. But don't worry, we'll go through them in the user guide.

* Following the `add` are the parameters or the arguments that the command needs.
In this case, the `add` command require these parameters from you:
+

[horizontal]
*ROLE*:: Role of the person being added into the program. +
*NAME*:: The name of the person being added into the program. +
*PHONE*:: The phone number of the person being added. +
*EMAIL*:: A valid email consisting of existing domain and proper format of the person. +
*ADDRESS*:: The address of the person being added. +
*TAGS*:: (OPTIONAL)

* Parameters in uppercase states that they need to be supplied by the user.
They have a prefix on them like r/, n/, p/, e/, a/ and t/ that needs to be typed by the user.
These prefixes tells the program the different parameter types.

* Parameters enclosed by square brackets like [t/TAG] suggests that the argument is *optional*. +
The user may choose to omit the parameter or add it.

* Parameters with ... appended to it, for example [t/TAG]... suggests that the parameter can be added multiple times. +
If the user chooses to do, he or she *should not* omit the prefix of the argument, for this instance, t/. +

* *Parameters of the commands can be typed in any order that the user chooses as long as the prefix of the argument is not omitted.*
