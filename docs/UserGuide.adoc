== Introduction

VetterAppointments is a program for vets who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their Clients, Pets and Appointments. +

The app is optimized for Vets who prefer to work with the *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that clearly lists out what is important to him or her. +

VetterAppointments allows a vet to manage and complete his tasks faster than the traditional GUI app provided he or she is a fast typer. To get started with the app, head down to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +

+
.  Download the latest `VetterAppointments.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your VetterAppointments.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
